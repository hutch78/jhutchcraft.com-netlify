          I have been leading UI\UX design as well as front end development for Renters Warehouse for 3 years now. RW
          went from strictly handling property management to becoming a full-service real estate investing services
          company. We built an MLS search that is just as capable as Zillow.com or Realtor.com. We have designed and
          built tools that provided our agents with better quality of life, and a better ability to serve our clients.
